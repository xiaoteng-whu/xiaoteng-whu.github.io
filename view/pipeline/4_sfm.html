                    The objective of this step is to understand the geometric relationship behind all the observations provided by the input images, and infer the rigid scene structure (3D points) with the pose (position and orientation) and internal calibration of all cameras.
                    The Incremental pipeline is a growing reconstruction process.
                    It first computes an initial two-view reconstruction that is iteratively extended by adding new views.

                <p>
                    First, it fuses all feature matches between image pairs into tracks.
                    Each track is supposed to represent a point in space, visible from multiple cameras.
                    However, at this step of the pipeline, it still contains many outliers.
                    During this fusion of matches, we remove incoherent tracks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, the incremental algorithm has to choose the best initial image pair.
                    This choice is critical for the quality of the final reconstruction.
                    It should indeed provide robust matches and contain reliable geometric information.
                    So, this image pair should maximize the number of matches and the repartition of the corresponding features in each image.
                    But at the same time, the angle between the cameras should also be large enough to provide reliable geometric information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then we compute the fundamental matrix between these 2 images and consider that the first one is the origin of the coordinate system.
                    Now that we know the pose of the 2 first cameras, we can triangulate the corresponding 2D features into 3D points.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After that, we select all the images that have enough associations with the features that are already reconstructed in 3D.
                    This algorithm is called next best views selection.
                    Based on these 2D-3D associations it performs the resectioning of each of these new cameras.
                    The resectioning is a Perspective-n-Point algorithm (PnP) in a RANSAC framework to find the pose of the camera that validates most of the features associations.
                    On each camera, a non-linear minimization is performed to refine the pose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From these new cameras poses, some tracks become visible by 2 or more resected cameras and it triangulates them.
                    Then, we launch a Bundle Adjustment to refine everything: extrinsics and intrinsics parameters of all cameras as well as the position of all 3D points.
                    We filter the results of the Bundle Adjustment by removing all observations that have high reprojection error or insufficient angles between observations.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we have triangulated new points, we get more image candidates for next best views selection.
                    We iterate like that, adding cameras and triangulating new 2D features into 3D points and removing 3D points that became invalidated, until we canâ€™t localize new views.
                </p>
